Growth experiment data: coscinodiscus diatoms isolated from a station in the Amazon 
river plume (from Colleen Durkin, cdurkin@mlml.calstate.edu).

T - time in days

RFU - relative fluorescence units (proxy for diatom abundance)

Growth experiments were conducted in nutrient replete conditions on a 24 hour
light/dark cycle. All RFU measurements were taken in the same phase of this cycle.
